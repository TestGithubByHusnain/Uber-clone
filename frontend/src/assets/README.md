Place your provided PNG logo files here with these exact filenames:

- nextride-logo.png        — used on Home page (light logo)
- nextride-dark.png        — used on Login and Captain Login pages (dark/white-on-dark logo)

You uploaded two images: one with dark text (use `nextride-logo.png`) and one with white text (use `nextride-dark.png`).

How to install:
1. Copy the PNG files you uploaded into this folder.
2. Restart the frontend dev server (if running) to pick up the new assets.

If you want, I can also convert these PNGs to optimized web formats or import them as React components.
